All gone away
All gone away
I place my head against your skin
As I did as a boy

And still, your hands feel cold
Those hands that brushed my hair
I feel you everywhere
And I'll carry you inside of me
In every place that I will be

And still, the warm winds will blow
Still, all the rivers flow
And still, the green grass will grow
In every place I choose to go

I wander 'round the house
In which we lived
Cupboards full of coats and hats
Your presence everywhere

And in every corner, memories form
You warmed us like the sun
And every morning, you'd be there
Now you're gone
And you warmed me like the sun

In your belly
With your food
In your love of family and friends
The dogs and the horses too
In the life of the conversation
Connecting one and all
And your spirit would find
Its place, its home, its face in the music

Your eyes, so young, so old
Still, your hands are cold
I feel you everywhere
And I'll carry you inside of me
In every place that I can be

And still, the warm winds will blow
Still, all the rivers will flow
And still, the green grass will grow
In every place I choose to go
I carry you inside of me
